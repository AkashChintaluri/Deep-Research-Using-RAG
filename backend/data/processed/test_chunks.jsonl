Myers ABSTRACT Wediscuss theresults fromthecombined IRACandMIPS c2dSpitzer Legacy observations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSOs, from the extensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss the prop- erties of the resulting high confidence set of YSOs. We find 235 such objects in 2 the 0.85 deg field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An additional set of 51 lower confidence YSOs outside this area is identified from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. To understand the properties of the circumstellar material that produces the observed infrared emission, we describe two sets ofresults, theuse ofcolor-colordiagramstocompareour observed source properties with those of theoretical models for stardiskenvelope systems and our own modeling of the subset of our objects that appear to be well represented by a stellar photosphere plus circumstellar disk. These objects exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSOs in Serpens extends down to at least a few 103 L or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc. The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSOs from extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSOs at very low luminosities.

A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSOs are more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO population and our Spitzer data set. The clusters in Serpens have a very high surface density of YSOs, primarily with SEDs suggesting extreme youth. The total number of YSOs, mostly Class II, is greater in the region outside the clusters. Subject headings: infrared: general clouds: star forming regions 1. Introduction The Serpens star-forming cloud is one of five such large clouds selected for observation as part of The Spitzer Legacy project FromMolecular Cores to Planet-forming Disks (c2d) (Evans et al. 2003). Previous papers in this series have described the observational results in theSerpensCloudasseenwithIRAC(Harvey et. al.2006)(PaperI)andMIPS(Harvey et al. 2007) as well as some of the other clouds (Jorgensen et al. 2006; Rebull et al. 2006). In this paper we examine how the combination of the IRAC and MIPS data together with other published results on this region can be used to find and characterize a highly reliable catalog of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the surveyed area.

In this paper we examine how the combination of the IRAC and MIPS data together with other published results on this region can be used to find and characterize a highly reliable catalog of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the surveyed area. With the combination of broad wavelength coverage and amazing depth of Spitzers sensitivity we are able to probe to both extremely low luminosity limits for YSOs and to cover a very wide range in dust emission, both in optical depth and in range of emitting temperatures. The Spitzer wavelength region is particularly well tuned for sensitivity to dust at temperatures appropriate for solar-system size disks around young stars. The region of the Serpens Cloud mapped in our survey is an area rich in star for- mation. Eiroa, Djupvik Casali (2007) have extensively reviewed studies at a variety of wavelengths of this area. There is evidence from previous observations of strong cluster- ing (Testi et al. 2000; Testi Sargent 1998), dense sub-mm cores (Casali, Eiroa Duncan 1993; Enoch et al. 2007), and high-velocity outflows (Ziener Eisloffel 1999; Davis et al. 1999). Pre-Spitzer infraredsurveys of the cloudhave been made by IRAS (Zhang et al. 1988; Zhang, Laureijs, Clark1988)andISO(Kaas et al.2004;Djupvik et al.2006)aswell asthe pioneering ground-based surveys that first identified it as an important region of star forma- tion (Strom, Vrba Strom 1976). Using MIPS and all four bands of IRAC the c2d program 2 has mapped a 0.85 deg portion of this cloud that includes a very well-studied cluster of in- 3 fraredandsub-millimetersources(Eiroa Casali1992;Hogerheijde, van Dishoeck, Salverda 1999; Hurt Barsony 1996; Harvey, Wilking, Joy 1984; Testi Sargent 1998). At its distance of 26010 pc (Straizys, Cernis, Bartasiute 1996) this corresponds to an area of about 2.5 9 pc. In paper I we identified at least two main centers of star formation as seen by Spitzer in this cloud, that we referred to as Cluster A and B. Cluster A is the very well-studied grouping also commonly referred to as the Serpens Core. Cluster B was the subject of a recent multi-wavelength study by Djupvik et al. (2006), who referred to it as the Serpens G3-G6 cluster.

We characterize the circumstellar material with color-color diagrams that allow comparison with other recent studies of star-forming regions, and we model the energy distributions of the large number of YSOs that appear to be starcircumstellar disk systems. We are able to construct the YSO luminosity function for Serpens since we have complete spectral coverage for all the sources over the range of wavelengths where their luminosity is emitted, and we are able to characterize the selection effects inherent in the luminosity function from comparison with the publicly available and signicantly deeper SWIRE survey (Surace et al. 2004).

We discuss in 6 the YSO luminosity function in Serpens and, in particular, the low end of this function. We next analyze the spatial distribution of star formation in the surveyed area and compare it to the distribution of dust extinction as derived from our observations in 7. In 8 we construct several color-color diagrams that characterize the global properties of the circumstellar material and show modeling results for a large fraction of our YSOs that appear to be stardisk systems. Finally, 9 discusses several specific groups of objects including the coldests YSOs and a previously identified disappearing YSO. We also men- tion several obvious high-velocity outflows from YSOs that will certainly be the subject of further study. 4 2. Observations The parameters of our observations have already been described in detail in Paper I for IRAC and in a companion study (Harvey et al. 2007) for MIPS. We summarize here some of the issues most relevant to this study. We remind the reader that the angular resolution of the Spitzer imaging instruments varies widely with wavelength, since Spitzer is diffraction limited longward of Î» 10Âµm. In the shorter IRAC bands the spatial resolution is of order 2, while from 24160Âµm, it goes from roughly 5 to 50. The area chosen for mapping was defined by the AV 6 contour in the extinction map of Cambresy (1999) and by practical time constraints (Evans et al. 2 2003). With the exception of a small area of 0.04 deg on the northeast edge of the IRAC map, all of the area mapped with IRAC was also covered with MIPS at both 24 and 70Âµm, and most of it at 160Âµm. As described by Harvey et al. (2007), some substantial additional area was observed with MIPS without matching IRAC observations. In this current paper 2 we restrict our attention to only the area that was observed from 3.6 to 70Âµm, 0.85 deg . This entire region was observed from 3.6 to 24Âµm at two epochs, with a time separation of several hours to several days, but at only one epoch at 70Âµm. We also specifically do not include the 160Âµm observations in our discussion because they did not cover the entire area and because most of the YSOs in Serpens are too closely clustered to be distinguishable in the large beam of the 160Âµm data. Harvey et al. (2007) discuss briefly the extended 160Âµm emission in this region and the four point-like sources found at 160Âµm. Figure 1 shows the entire area mapped with all four IRAC bands and MIPS at 24 and 70Âµm and also indicates the locations of several areas mentioned in the text. In addition to this area of the Serpens cloud defined by relatively high AV, we also observed small off-cloud regions around the molecular cloud with relatively low AV in order to determine the background star and galaxy counts. The area of combined IRACMIPS coverage of these off-cloud regions, however, was relatively small and so these observations are not discussed further in this paper.

As detailed below, we have used the much larger and deeper SWIRE (Surace et al. 2004) survey to understand the characteristics of the most serious background contaminants in our maps, the extra-galactic objects. 3. YSO Selection Paper I described a process for classifying infrared objects into several categories: those whose energy distributions could be well-fitted as reddened stellar photospheres, those that had a high likelihood of being background galaxies, and those that were viable YSO candi- 5 Fig. 1.

We have refined this process by combining MIPS and IRAC data together as well as by producing an improved comparison catalog from the SWIRE (Surace et al. 2004) survey, trimmed as accurately as possible to the c2d sensitivity limits. As shown by the number counts versus Wainscoat models of the Galactic background toward Serpens in paper I, nearly all the sources observed in our survey are likely to be background stars. Because of the high sensitivity of IRAC channels 1 and 2 relative to both 2MASS and to IRAC channels 3 and 4, most of the more than 200,000 sources extracted from our Serpens dataset do not have enough spectral coverage for any reliable classification algorithm. In particular, only 34,000 sources had enough spectral information from a combination of 2MASS and IRAC data to permit a test for consistency with a stellar photosphere-plus-extinction model, and nearly 32,000 of these objects were classified as reddened stellar photospheres. These normal stellar objects are not considered further in our discussion and are not plotted on the various color and magnitude diagrams. The details of this classification process and the criteria for fitting are described in detail by Evans et al. (2007). In order to pursue the classification process for YSOs beyond that described in Paper I, we added one more step to the data processing described there. This final step was band-filling the catalog to obtain upper limits or low SN detections of objects that were not found in the original source extraction processing. This step is described in detail in the delivery documentation for the final c2d data delivery (Evans et al. 2007). In short, though, it involved fixing the position of the source during anextraction at the position of an existing catalog source and fitting the image data at that fixed position for two parameters, a background level and source flux, assuming it was a point source. For this processing step, the fluxes of all the originally extracted sources were subtracted from the image first. In the case of the data discussed in this paper, the most important contribution of this band-filling step is to give us flux estimates for the YSO candidates and extra-galactic candidates at 24Âµm. Because our knowledge of the true PSF is imperfect and because the 24Âµm PSF is so much larger than the IRAC ones, it was also necessary to examine these results carefully to be sure a band-filled 24Âµm flux was not simply the poorly subtracted wings of a nearby bright source", "start_offset": 10021, "end_offset": 13723, "title": "The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Insterstellar Clouds.

For the purposes of this paper, all upper limits are given as 5Ï values. Three of the sources eventually selected as YSOs by the process described below had 24Âµm fluxes that were obviously saturated. These are the objects in Table 2 numbered 127, 137, and 182. For these three objects we derived the 24Âµm flux from a fit to the wings of the source profiles, rather than a fit to the whole profile as is done by the standard c2d source extraction. 7 3.1. Constructing a Control Catalog from Deep Extragalactic SWIRE Observations We use the IRAC and MIPS images of the ELAIS N1 field obtained by the SWIRE team as a control field for understanding the extragalactic populationwith colors that mimic those of YSOs present in our Serpens field. This SWIRE field, expected to contain no extinction 2 from a molecular cloud and no YSOs, has coverage by both IRAC and MIPS of 5.31 deg and has a limiting flux roughly a factor of four below that of our observations of Serpens. The analysis described below is designed to produce a resampled version of the SWIRE field as it would have been observed with the typical c2d sensitivity and as if it were located behind a molecular cloud with the range of extinctions observed in Serpens. The process of simulating these effects is discussed in detail in the final c2d data delivery documentation (Evans et al. 2007), but the steps are summarized here. To avoid effects that may result from differences in data processing, the BCD images for this SWIRE field were processed by our pipeline in exactly the same way as our own obser- vations. Once a bandmerged catalog of SWIRE sources was constructed, we first simulated the reddening of sources that would occur if Serpens had been in the foreground of this field. This reddening was accomplished by randomly applying extinction to each SWIRE source according to the extinction profile of Serpens, shown in Figure 2. For example, 23 of SWIRE sources were randomly selected and visual extinctions in the range 6.5 AV 7.5 were applied, 19 of sources were extincted by extinctions in the range 7.5 AV 8.5, and so forth. The extinctions were applied to each of the infrared bands according to the extinction law appropriate for molecular clouds and cores (Huard et al., in prep.). Second, we degraded the sensitivity of the reddened SWIRE photometry to match that of our Serpens observations. This was accomplished by matching the detection rates as a function of magnitude in each of the bands. The 90 completeness limits of the Serpens observations are approximately 16.6, 15.6, 15.0, 16.6, 16.2, 15.2, 13.4, and 9.6 mag at J, H, K, 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, and 24, respectively. Thus, for each band, all reddened SWIRE sources brighter than the completeness limit in Serpens would be detectable by c2d-like observations and are identified as such in the resampled SWIRE catalog. Most, but not all, sources fainter than the completeness limit will not be detected by c2d-like observations.

Thus, for each band, all reddened SWIRE sources brighter than the completeness limit in Serpens would be detectable by c2d-like observations and are identified as such in the resampled SWIRE catalog. Most, but not all, sources fainter than the completeness limit will not be detected by c2d-like observations. We randomly select which sources to identify as detections, in a given band, in such as way as to reproduce the empirically determined shape of the completeness function. This resampling process is performed for each band, resulting in those sources fainter than the completeness limits in some bands being detected or not detected with the same probabilities as those for similar sources in Serpens. The photometric uncertainties of all sources in the resampled catalog of reddened SWIRE sources are re-assigned uncertainties similar to those of Serpens 8 sources with similar magnitudes. Finally, each source in the resampled SWIRE catalog is re-classified, based on its de- graded photometry, e.g. star, YSOc, GALc, .... The magnitudes, colors, and classi- fications of sources in this resampled SWIRE catalog are then directly comparable to those in our Serpens catalog and may be used to estimate the population of extragalactic sources satisfying various color and magnitude criteria. At this level of the classification, the terms YSOc and GALc imply candidate classification status. 3.2. Classification Based on Color and Magnitude In Paper I we described a simple set of criteria that basically categorized all objects that were faint and red in several combinations of IRAC and MIPS colors as likely to be galaxies (after removal of normal reddened stars). In our new classification we have extended this concepttoincludethecolorandmagnitudespacesinFigure3togetherwithseveraladditional criteriatocomputeaproxyfortheprobabilitythatasourceisaYSOorabackgroundgalaxy. Figure 3 shows a collection of three color-magnitude diagrams and one color-color diagram used to classify the sources found in our 3.6 to 70Âµm survey of the Serpens Cloud that had SN 3 in all the Spitzer bands between 3 and 24Âµm and that were not classified as reddened stellar photospheres. In addition to the Serpens sources shown in the left panels, the comparable set of sources from the full-sensitivity SWIRE catalog are shown in the center panels, and the sources remaining in the extinctedsensitivity-resampled version of the SWIRE catalog described above are shown in the right panels. The exact details of our classification scheme are described in Appendix A. Basically we form the product of individual probabilities from each of the three color-magnitude diagrams in Figure 3 and then use additional factors to modify that total probability based on source properties such as: its K - 4.5 color, whether it was found to be extended in either of the shorter IRAC bands, and whether its flux density is above or below some empirically determined limits in several critical bands. Table 1 summarizes the criteria used for this class separation. The cutoffs in each of the color-magnitude diagrams and the final probability threshold to separate YSOs from extragalactic objects were chosen: (1) to provide a nearly complete elimination of all SWIRE objects from the YSO class, and (2) to maximize the number of YSOs selected in Serpens consistent with visual inspection of the images to eliminate obvious extragalactic objects (such as a previously uncatalogued obvious spiral galaxy at RA 18h 29m 57.4s , Dec 00 31 41 J2000 ). The cutoffs in color-magnitude space were constructed as smooth, exponentially de- caying probabilities around the dashed lines in each of the three diagrams. Sources far 9 Fig. 2.

In the case of the 24 versus 8.0-24 relation, the probability dropped off radially away from the center of the elliptical segment shown inthe figure. After inclusion ofthese three color-magnitudecriteria, we added the additional criteria listed in Table 1. These included: (1) a factor dependent on the K - 4.5 color, Prob(K4.5), to reflect the higher probability of a source being an extra-galactic (GALc) contaminant if it is bluer in that color, (2) a higher GALc probability for sources that are extended at either 3.6 or 4.8Âµmwhere our survey had the best sensitivity and highest spatial resolution, (3) a decrease in GALc probability for sources with a 70Âµm flux density above 400 mJy, empirically determined from examination of the SWIRE data, and (4) identification as extragalactic for any source fainter than 24 10.0. Again, we emphasize that these criteria are based only on the empirical approach of trying to charac- terize the SWIRE population in color-magnitude space as precisely as possible, not on any kind of modeling of the energy distributions. Figure 4 graphically shows the division between YSOs and likely extragalactic contam- inants. The number counts versus our probability are shown for both the Serpens cloud and for the resampled SWIRE catalog (normalized to the Serpens area). This illustrates how cleanly the objects in the SWIRE catalog are identified by this probability criterion. In the Serpens sample there are clearly two well-separated groups of objects plus a tail of intermediate probability objects that we have mostly classified as YSOs since no such tail is apparent in the SWIRE sample. Our choice of the exact cut between YSO and XGal in Figure 4 is somewhat ar- bitrary because of the low level tail of objects in Serpens in the area of log(probability) -1.5. Since the area of sky included in our SWIRE sample is more than six times as large as the mapped area of Serpens, we chose our final probability cut, log(P) 1.47, to allow two objects from the full (not resampled) SWIRE catalog into the YSO classifica- tion bin. Thus, aside from the vagaries of small-number statistics, we expect of order 0 1 extragalactic interlopers in our list of Serpens YSOs. The right panels in Figure 3, which use the resampled version of the SWIRE catalog, show that the effects of sensitivity and, especially, the extinction in Serpens make our cutoff limits particularly conservative in terms of likelihood of misclassification. We examined all the YSO candidates chosen with these criteria both in terms of the quality of the photometry and their appearance in the images. A significant number, 50 candidates were discarded because of the poor quality of the bandfilling process at 24Âµm due to contamination by a nearby brighter source or because of their appearance in the images. It is possible that a small number of these discarded candidates are, in fact, true YSOs in the Serpens Cloud.

It is possible that a small number of these discarded candidates are, in fact, true YSOs in the Serpens Cloud. We also manually classified one source as YSO ( 75 in Table 2) that may be the exciting source for an HH-like outflow in 11 Cluster B (see also discussion of this region by Harvey et al. (2007)), but which was not so classified because of its extended structure in the IRAC bands. Table 2 lists the 235 YSOs that resulted from this selection process. Another test of the success of our separation of background contaminants is to simply plot the locations of the YSOs and likely galaxies on the sky. Figure 5 shows such a plot in addition to a plot of visual extinction discussed later. There is clearly a very uniform distribution of background contaminants and a quite clustered distribution of YSOs (see further discussion in 7). There is one additional kind of contaminant that is likely to appear in our data at a relatively lowlevel, AGBstars. The ISOobservationsby, forexample, van Loon et al.(1999) andTrams et al.(1999)showthattherangeofbrightnessesofAGBstarsintheLMCcoversa span equivalent roughly to 8 8.0 12, with colors generally equivalent to 4.58.0 1. Very compact proto-planetary nebulae are generally redder, but even brighter at 8Âµm (see e.g. Hora et al. 1996). For typical galactic AGB stars, between 5 and 15 kpc from the sun, this would imply 3 8.0 9. The off-cloud fields (when normalized to the same area as the Serpens data) provide the best handle on the degree of contamination from AGB stars; in Paper I we saw one object classified as a YSO candidate in the off-cloud panel of Figure 9 with 8.0 9. Therefore, based on the ratio of areas mapped in Serpens versus the off-cloud observations, we expect the number of AGB stars contaminating the YSO candidate list in the Serpens cloud to be of order a half dozen. As a further check, we have examined the 2 entire set of off-cloud fields for such objects. In this combined area of 0.58 deg , there are only 3 such YSO candidates. Finally, MerÄ±n et al. (2007) have classified four AGB stars by their Spitzer-IRS spectra in the Serpens cloud; these are identified in the diagrams of Figure 3 by black open diamonds and obviously are not included in our final list of high-probability YSOs. Statistically then, it is possible that a couple of our brightest YSOs are in fact AGB stars. In fact, MerÄ±n et al. (2007) have obtained modest SN optical spectra of a number of our YSOs. They find five objects whose estimated extinction seems inconsistent with their location in the Serpens cloud and which suggests they might be background objects at much larger distances with modest circumstellar shells like AGB stars. We have indicated these five objects in Table 2 with a footnote b. It is also interesting to ask the reverse question, to what extent have our criteria suc- cessfully selected objects that were known YSOs from previous observations. Alcala et al. (2007) have used the same criteria to search for YSOs in the c2d data for Chamaeleon II. They conclude that all but one of the known YSOs in that region are identified. In 5 we discuss the comparison of our results with several previous studies of Serpens that searched for YSOs.

Most of these were indeed suggested only as candidate YSOs by the authors, so we do not consider this fact to be a problem for our selection criteria. We again emphasize the fact that our selection criteria for youth are based solely on the presence of an infrared excess at some Spitzer wavelength. The total number of objects classified as YSOs in the IRACMIPS overlap area of the Serpens cloud is 235. From the statistics of our classification of the SWIRE data we expect of order 1 1 of these are likely to be galaxies. On the other hand, as we discuss in 6, some of the faint red objects in Figure 3 (below the dashed line) may also be young sub- stellar objects. For example, we note the case of the young brown dwarf BD-Ser 1 found by Lodieu et al. (2002) that was not selected by our criteria because of its relative faintness. Of these 235, 198 were detected in at least the H and Ks bands of the 2MASS survey at better than 7Ï. The number of YSOs in each of the four classes of the system suggested by Lada (1987) and extended by Greene et al. (1994) is: 39 Class I, 25 Class Flat, 132 Class II, and 39 Class III, using the flux densities available between 1 and 24Âµm. Because we require some infrared excess to be identified as a YSO, the Class III candidates were necessarily selected by some measurable excess typically at the longer wavelengths, 8 or 24Âµm. An obvious corollary is that objects identified as young on the basis of other indicators, e.g. X-ray emission, lithium abundance, but without excesses in the range of 1 24Âµm are", "start_offset": 26111, "end_offset": 29575, "title": "The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Insterstellar Clouds.

YSOs Selected By MIPS Harvey et al. (2007) found 250 YSO candidates in the entire area mapped by MIPS 2 at 24Âµm in Serpens, an area of 1.8 deg ; 51 of these are outside the IRACMIPS overlap area and are listed in Table 3. We can make a comparison of those statistics with the YSO counts here in two ways. First in the area covered by both IRAC and MIPS24 there are 197 objects that satisfy the criteria of Harvey et al. (2007), i.e., Ks 14, Ks 24 2, 24 10 and 24Âµm SN 5. Of these, 184 satisfy our more restrictive criteria in this study based on the combination of 2MASS, IRAC, and MIPS data, or 93. We would classify the other 13 as likely background galaxies. Secondly, of the 235 YSOs found in this study, 200 have sufficient data to be classifiable by the mips only criteria above, but only 167 or 84 actually meet the mips-only YSO criteria. In other words, 33 objects have been classified as high quality YSOs in this paper in the MIPSIRAC overlap region that did not meet the criteria based only on MIPS and 2MASS data. If these ratios can be extrapolated to 16 the larger area covered only by MIPS, then we would expect Harvey et al. (2007) to have missed 16 (8 or 9) of the YSOs but to have included 7 (3 or 4) that would not meet our combined IRACMIPS criteria. With these corrections we might have expected to find 2 23556 291 YSOs in the entire 1.8 deg area covered by MIPS if we had matching IRAC observations. Finally, in light of our earlier discussion of AGB contaminants, it is possible that 6 9 of these YSOs would actually be found to be background AGB stars. 4. Search for Variability The fact that our data were taken in two epochs separated by 6 hours or more gives us the opportunity to search for variability over that time scale. Rebull et al. (2006) and Harvey et al. (2007) have performed similar tests for variability of the 24Âµm emission from sources in the c2d observations of Perseus and Serpens and found no reliable evidence for variability at that wavelength. There is, however, substantial evidence for short term vari- ability in the near-infrared for YSOs. We, therefore, performed a similar investigation in the two shortest IRAC bands, 3.6 and 4.5Âµm. No clear evidence was found at the level of 25 for any sources in the field over the 6-hour time scale of our multi-epoch observations. 5. Comparison with Previous Studies of Serpens We have cross-correlated our source catalog with those from previous studies of Serpens thatsearchedforYSOs.

Table 4 lists the sources from each of these previous studies and the best-matching Spitzer source from our complete catalog. In brief, we find good matches for essentially all the previous IR-selected YSOs that had SN 4 in the earlier studies and which", "start_offset": 29127, "end_offset": 32553, "title": "The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Insterstellar Clouds.
